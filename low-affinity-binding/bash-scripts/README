These scripts all assume some general level of familiarity with AMBER, and the shell enviorment. 

Please note that the AMBERHOME variable is subject to change based on location of Amber.

Files are organized in a manner as such-

  PCA_BA.sh

    Protein backbone PCA script. 

    cpptraj script (wrapped in shell) for protein backbone PCA of the four systems, and follow up analysis of the data (scree plot, and generating pseudo-trajectories of the first two PCs. Make sure to update pcmin/pcmax in second cpptraj section.


  PCA_SC.sh

    Protein sidechain PCA script. 

    cpptraj script (wrapped in shell) for protein sidechain PCA of the four systems, with follow up analysis (scree plot, pseudo-trajectories of the first two PCs). Make sure to update pcmin/pcmax in second cpptraj section.

  cpptraj_run.sh
  
    cpptraj analysis script. 
    
    cpptraj script (wrapped in shell) for analzying RMSD, RMSF, water counts per residue, hydrogen bond content, distances, and atom counts around various masks. 
    
   run_curves+.sh
   
   Shell script to assist in running curves+ and processing the data into easily interpetable forms.
   
   Note- the input trajectories should only have DNA present.
